/*Meadowdale Dairy Farm sells organic brown eggs to local customers. It charges
$3.25 for a dozen eggs, or 45 cents for individual eggs that are not part of a
dozen. Write a program that prompts a user for the number of eggs in the
order and then display the amount owed with a full explanation. For example,
typical output might be, You ordered 27 eggs. Thatâ€™s 2 dozen at $3.25 per
dozen and 3 loose eggs at 45 cents each for a total of $7.85. Save the program
as Eggs.java
